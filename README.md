# WWM MobileChallenge

Hi guys!

After installing our hardware in thousands of cars we are in a hurry.

Our Operations Department has been asking for a new Master App for a while.

This are their app specs:

1. Scan all Bluetooth devices around and show them in a table/list. They would like to see al devices no matter if they are not WWM hardwares.
